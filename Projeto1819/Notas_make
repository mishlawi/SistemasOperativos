Algumas notas sobre a make:

Está a dar erro pq temos main em todos os programas.

Fui ao stackoverflow e deram-nos estes conselhos:

1: " Your Makefile looks fine - I can't see any problems with it as such[*]. The problem is your code that you're compiling.
Take a look at one of the errors you're getting:

obj/src/sv.o: In function `main':
sv.c:(.text+0xcb5): multiple definition of `main'
obj/src/ag.o:ag.c:(.text+0x6ef): first defined here

That is saying that you have a file called "sv.c" that has a function called main in it.
And that you have another file called "ag.c" that also has a function called main in it.
You're trying to compile both those files into the same program, but you're only allowed to have one function called main.

[*] At a guess it looks like you've got several programs living in your "src" directory and your
Makefile is trying to build everything into one giant program.
If this is the case you need to either separate the code into their own directories or change your
Makefile so that SOURCES only lists the source files that are relevant to the program you're compiling."

2: "SOURCES = $(wildcard $(SDIR)/*.c). Always a bad idea to blindly grab all source files that happen to exist.
Specify the the sources of your program by name in your makefile."

Ao que eu passei a meter => SOURCES := ag.c sv.c cv.c ma.c e começou a dar o erro:

"make:*** No rule to make target 'obj/ag.o', needed by 'program'. Stop."
